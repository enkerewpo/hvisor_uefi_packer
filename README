hvisor UEFI Image Packer
========================

currently support for aarch64 and loongarch64 hvisor UEFI loader compilation

build instruction:

-------------------------------------------
make menuconfig
ARCH=aarch64 BOARD=qemu-gicv3 ./make_image
-------------------------------------------

the ARCH and BOARD will also be used to build hvisor in make_image

since we also need to cross compile the gnu-efi, use ./make_image will done everything automatically
you can also just run `make` to build but please notice the environment variables and the gnu-efi cross compile
static library
